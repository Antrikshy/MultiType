MultiType
=========

A single-page static site that puts entered text through a gauntlet of transformations. Future transformations can be built as plug-and-play Vue components.

MultiType is a spiritual successor to [CringeType](https://github.com/Antrikshy/CringeType), another web design mini project of mine from years ago.

This is a fun little toy project I built over the course of a couple of weeks to learn the basics of Vue.
